  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <h3>How do I choose the right journal for my paper?</h3>
  <p>Match scope, audience, and article type first; then check recent papers, acceptance rate, typical time-to-decision, indexing (Scopus/Web of Science), and open-access policies. The book’s Journal-Fit Matrix helps you shortlist and rank realistic targets.</p>

  <h3>What’s the ideal structure for a scientific article?</h3>
  <p>Use the IMRaD model: Introduction (problem &amp; gap), Methods (transparent &amp; reproducible), Results (findings only), and Discussion (meaning, limitations, implications). The book provides section-by-section language templates to speed drafting.</p>

  <h3>How do I write a high-impact title and abstract?</h3>
  <p>Title: precise problem + population/method + key outcome (avoid clickbait). Abstract: one paragraph with background, objective, methods, key results (effect size &amp; uncertainty), and impact. Include 5–7 specific keywords aligned to the journal’s indexing terms.</p>

  <h3>What do editors look for in the Methods &amp; Results?</h3>
  <p>Methods: design, participants/data, measures, procedures, analysis plan, preregistration, and software. Results: primary outcomes first, exact statistics (effect sizes, CIs, p-values), and no interpretation. Use reporting checklists to avoid omissions.</p>

  <h3>How do I prepare figures, tables, and supplementary files?</h3>
  <p>Use self-contained captions, consistent units/labels, and journal-compliant formats (vector for line art, high-res for images). Put robustness checks, protocols, and extra analyses in supplements. The book includes a figure/table checklist.</p>

  <h3>What belongs in a strong cover letter?</h3>
  <p>1) One-sentence contribution, 2) why this journal’s audience, 3) novelty vs prior work, 4) compliance (ethics/data/COI), 5) suggested reviewers (optional) and exclusions (with rationale). Keep it one page.</p>

  <h3>Top reasons papers get rejected—and quick fixes?</h3>
  <p>Mismatched scope, weak gap, underpowered or unclear methods, analytic errors, oversized claims, or poor writing. The book’s “Rejection Triage” maps each reason to targeted rewrites and checks (power, robustness, language polish).</p>

  <h3>How should I respond to peer-review comments?</h3>
  <p>Use a point-by-point response. Quote each comment, state the change, and show where it appears in the manuscript. If you disagree, offer data-based justification and a compromise. Maintain a professional tone.</p>

  <h3>Which reporting guidelines should I follow?</h3>
  <p>Use domain-appropriate standards (e.g., CONSORT for trials, PRISMA for reviews, STROBE for observational studies, COREQ for qualitative). Many journals require a completed checklist at submission—include it.</p>

  <h3>Are preprints and open access a good idea?</h3>
  <p>Preprints can speed visibility, establish priority, and attract feedback (check journal policies). Open access increases reach; weigh APCs vs funder mandates. The book outlines safe preprint and OA strategies.</p>

  <h3>How do I handle authorship, ethics, and AI use?</h3>
  <p>Define contributions with CRediT taxonomy, confirm IRB/ethics where needed, register trials, and disclose funding/COIs. If using AI tools, document tasks (e.g., copy-editing) and verify all content; authors—not tools—remain accountable.</p>

  <h3>How can I make my paper discoverable after publication?</h3>
  <p>Choose precise keywords/MeSH terms, write a lay summary, share a preprint or accepted manuscript when allowed, and link data/code in trusted repositories with a DOI. The book includes a post-publication checklist.</p>

  <h3>How long does peer review take and how do I track progress?</h3>
  <p>Typical first decisions take 4–12 weeks. Monitor the submission portal; if timelines exceed the journal’s median and reviews are overdue, a polite inquiry to the editor is acceptable after their stated window.</p>
