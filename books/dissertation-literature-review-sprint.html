<h1 class="title">Dissertation Literature Review Sprint: Finish &amp; Defend Your Chapter in 30 Days — Powered by AI</h1>
<div class="sub">A focused, day-by-day plan to research, synthesize, and defend—fast and responsibly.</div>
<div class="hr"></div>

<p>
<strong>Dissertation Literature Review Sprint</strong> gives you a structured
<strong>30-day literature review sprint</strong> that balances reading and synthesis with a
practical <strong>daily research schedule</strong>. You’ll use <em>AI-assisted research</em> prompts,
<strong>evidence matrices</strong>, and <strong>concept maps</strong> to move from scattered sources to a
publishable, defensible chapter—without sacrificing academic integrity.
</p>

<p>
The plan emphasizes <strong>responsible AI usage</strong> (disclosure and verification), efficient
<strong>research reading strategies</strong>, <strong>summarising articles</strong> with note-taking systems,
and clear <strong>paraphrasing and academic voice</strong>. You’ll track sources with
<strong>citation management</strong> and manage <strong>cognitive load</strong> using sprint-friendly focus blocks.
It’s not a PRISMA systematic review; the <em>PRISMA vs sprint</em> guidance shows when
narrative/thematic synthesis is appropriate for a dissertation chapter.
</p>

<ul class="feature-list">
  <li><strong>30-day schedule:</strong> discovery → triage → synthesis → drafting → polish &amp; defense prep.</li>
  <li><strong>Daily prompts:</strong> AI-powered tasks for search expansion, triage, memoing, and theme testing.</li>
  <li><strong>Evidence matrices &amp; concept maps:</strong> convert notes to defensible themes and arguments.</li>
  <li><strong>Literature review templates:</strong> search logs, inclusion/exclusion sheets, and outline planners.</li>
  <li><strong>Note-taking systems:</strong> structured summaries, quote/claim tracking, and citation anchors.</li>
  <li><strong>Paraphrasing &amp; voice:</strong> sentence-level scaffolds to maintain clarity and integrity.</li>
  <li><strong>Time management for graduate students:</strong> 60–120-minute blocks, weekly check-ins, and buffers.</li>
  <li><strong>Citation management:</strong> organize sources, dedupe, and insert citations as you draft.</li>
  <li><strong>Responsible AI usage:</strong> retrieval-first prompts, verification steps, and disclosure language.</li>
  <li><strong>Defense preparation:</strong> slide blueprint, common committee questions, and talking-point cues.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Follow the sprint to finish a rigorous <strong>dissertation literature review</strong> in four weeks,
with a clean chapter, a documented search trail, and a defense-ready deck that clearly
links your themes, gaps, and research direction.

  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can I really finish a dissertation literature review in 30 days?</summary>
    <p>Yes—if you follow the focused daily plan (about 60–120 minutes a day) and stick to the scope you define in Week 1. The sprint replaces open-ended reading with structured search, triage, synthesis, drafting, and polish.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Will AI write the chapter for me?</summary>
    <p>No. AI assists; you decide. The book shows <em>responsible</em> use of ChatGPT, Elicit, Scite, Rayyan, and Zotero for discovery, triage, organization, and drafting—paired with verification steps, citation checks, and disclosure language.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Which AI and research tools are used in the 30-day plan?</summary>
    <p>ChatGPT (structured prompts), Elicit (paper discovery/triage), Scite (citation context), Rayyan (screening), ChatPDF (document Q&amp;A), Zotero (references), plus concept maps and evidence matrices to drive synthesis.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What if I’ve already read a lot but have messy notes?</summary>
    <p>Days 8–17 focus on turning scattered notes into themes, debates, and a defensible outline using evidence matrices, concept mapping, and summary tables. You’ll consolidate what you have instead of starting over.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Does the sprint help me avoid overreading and rabbit holes?</summary>
    <p>Yes. You’ll define inclusion/exclusion criteria, set a search log, and use AI-assisted triage to decide what to skip, skim, or study—then move quickly to synthesis and drafting.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is this a systematic review (PRISMA)?</summary>
    <p>No—it’s a dissertation <em>chapter</em> sprint (narrative/thematic). You’ll still document a transparent search strategy and screening decisions, and you can include a PRISMA-style flow diagram if your program expects it.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How does the book prevent AI hallucinations and bad citations?</summary>
    <p>You’ll use retrieval-first prompts, DOI/PDF-grounded extraction, Scite for citation context, and a verification checklist. The sprint prioritizes <em>traceable evidence</em> and accurate references in Zotero.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Does it cover paraphrasing, academic voice, and reference formatting?</summary>
    <p>Yes. Days 18–25 cover paraphrasing with integrity, voice/flow edits, and reference formatting (e.g., APA/MLA/journal guidelines) using Zotero + writing assistants like Trinka/Typeset.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Will this prepare me for my proposal or defense?</summary>
    <p>Yes. Days 26–30 link your review to the methods chapter, anticipate common committee questions, and help you defend choices about scope, inclusion, themes, and gaps.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What if English isn’t my first language?</summary>
    <p>The sprint includes clarity and tone checks, sentence-level revision prompts, and reviewer-style critiques to help you communicate clearly and confidently.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do I need paid tools?</summary>
    <p>No. The plan is “free-first.” Where a paid option is mentioned, a free/academic alternative is offered.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Who is this for?</summary>
    <p>PhD and master’s students writing a literature review chapter, returning researchers restarting a project, and anyone who needs a concrete, time-boxed plan to finish and defend with confidence.</p>
