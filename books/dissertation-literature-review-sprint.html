  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can I really finish a dissertation literature review in 30 days?</summary>
    <p>Yes—if you follow the focused daily plan (about 60–120 minutes a day) and stick to the scope you define in Week 1. The sprint replaces open-ended reading with structured search, triage, synthesis, drafting, and polish.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Will AI write the chapter for me?</summary>
    <p>No. AI assists; you decide. The book shows <em>responsible</em> use of ChatGPT, Elicit, Scite, Rayyan, and Zotero for discovery, triage, organization, and drafting—paired with verification steps, citation checks, and disclosure language.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Which AI and research tools are used in the 30-day plan?</summary>
    <p>ChatGPT (structured prompts), Elicit (paper discovery/triage), Scite (citation context), Rayyan (screening), ChatPDF (document Q&amp;A), Zotero (references), plus concept maps and evidence matrices to drive synthesis.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What if I’ve already read a lot but have messy notes?</summary>
    <p>Days 8–17 focus on turning scattered notes into themes, debates, and a defensible outline using evidence matrices, concept mapping, and summary tables. You’ll consolidate what you have instead of starting over.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Does the sprint help me avoid overreading and rabbit holes?</summary>
    <p>Yes. You’ll define inclusion/exclusion criteria, set a search log, and use AI-assisted triage to decide what to skip, skim, or study—then move quickly to synthesis and drafting.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is this a systematic review (PRISMA)?</summary>
    <p>No—it’s a dissertation <em>chapter</em> sprint (narrative/thematic). You’ll still document a transparent search strategy and screening decisions, and you can include a PRISMA-style flow diagram if your program expects it.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How does the book prevent AI hallucinations and bad citations?</summary>
    <p>You’ll use retrieval-first prompts, DOI/PDF-grounded extraction, Scite for citation context, and a verification checklist. The sprint prioritizes <em>traceable evidence</em> and accurate references in Zotero.</p>

    <p>Yes. Days 18–25 cover paraphrasing with integrity, voice/flow edits, and reference formatting (e.g., APA/MLA/journal guidelines) using Zotero + writing assistants like Trinka/Typeset.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Will this prepare me for my proposal or defense?</summary>
    <p>Yes. Days 26–30 link your review to the methods chapter, anticipate common committee questions, and help you defend choices about scope, inclusion, themes, and gaps.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What if English isn’t my first language?</summary>
    <p>The sprint includes clarity and tone checks, sentence-level revision prompts, and reviewer-style critiques to help you communicate clearly and confidently.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do I need paid tools?</summary>
