<h1 class="title">The AI-Powered Scholar: Transform Every Stage of Your Research With Cutting-edge AI</h1>
<div class="sub">Plan, execute, analyze, and write faster—without sacrificing rigor or integrity.</div>
<div class="hr"></div>

<p>
<strong>The AI-Powered Scholar</strong> gives you a <strong>stage-by-stage research workflow</strong> that integrates
<em>ethical AI in research</em> from idea to defense. You’ll use curated <strong>AI prompt libraries</strong> and a
practical tool stack—<strong>Semantic Scholar</strong>, <strong>ResearchRabbit</strong>, <strong>Elicit</strong>, <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, and
<strong>Copilot</strong>—to accelerate <em>AI literature search</em>, study design, data preparation, analysis, and
manuscript drafting, while keeping results <strong>reproducible</strong> and traceable.
</p>

<p>
Learn guardrails for <strong>AI hallucination prevention</strong>, disclosure language, and auditing so your
outputs meet transparency and <strong>replicability</strong> standards. Examples span both
<strong>qualitative research with AI</strong> (coding, memoing, thematic analysis) and
<strong>quantitative research with AI</strong> (data wrangling, exploratory analysis, figure/table scaffolds),
plus <em>AI code generation</em> patterns that stay verifiable.
</p>

<ul class="feature-list">
  <li><strong>Stage-by-stage workflows:</strong> topic → <em>AI literature search</em> → design → data prep → analysis → writing → defense.</li>
  <li><strong>AI prompt libraries:</strong> reusable prompts for discovery, screening, synthesis, critique, and revision.</li>
  <li><strong>Tool stack, explained:</strong> <em>Semantic Scholar tutorial</em>, ResearchRabbit mapping, Elicit triage, ChatGPT drafting, Copilot for data analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Ethical AI in research:</strong> disclosure templates, limits of use, and reviewer-safe practices.</li>
  <li><strong>Hallucination prevention:</strong> retrieval-first prompts, DOI/PDF grounding, citation checks.</li>
  <li><strong>Reproducible research:</strong> logs, versioning, exports, and checklists for <em>research reproducibility</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Qual &amp; quant with AI:</strong> codebooks, themes, and memos; data cleaning, EDA, and visualization scaffolds.</li>
  <li><strong>Manuscript drafting with AI:</strong> section-by-section patterns, reviewer-style self-checks, and transparency notes.</li>
  <li><strong>AI workflow automation:</strong> repeatable routines for search expansion, document triage, and results tracking.</li>
  <li><strong>Replicability &amp; transparency:</strong> audit trails that make AI-assisted decisions defensible.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Adopt a clear, ethical <strong>AI research workflow</strong> that speeds work without cutting corners—so
your manuscript, methods, and evidence trail stand up to peer review.
