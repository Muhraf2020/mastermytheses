  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <h3>What is the standard structure of a research proposal?</h3>
  <p>Most proposals include: Title, Abstract, Background &amp; gap, Aims/Objectives, Research Questions/Hypotheses, Methods (design, sampling, data collection, analysis), Timeline/Gantt, Budget &amp; justification (if required), Ethics/IRB, Expected outcomes &amp; impact, References. The book provides a fill-in-the-blanks template for each section.</p>

  <h3>How do I write strong aims, objectives, and research questions?</h3>
  <p>Start with a precise problem statement and gap. Aims are broad intentions; objectives are SMART steps; research questions (or hypotheses) directly test or explore the gap. Use the book’s “Reviewer X-Ray” to check alignment among gap → aims → methods.</p>

  <h3>What level of detail do reviewers expect in the methods?</h3>
  <p>Specify design (qual, quant, or mixed), participants &amp; sampling, instruments/measures, procedures, analysis plan, and quality/validity safeguards. Include feasibility notes (access, skills, tools) and a pilot/contingency plan where appropriate.</p>

  <h3>How do I justify sample size (or provide a power analysis)?</h3>
  <p>Quantitative proposals: estimate effect sizes and run an a priori power analysis. Qualitative proposals: justify depth via purposive/theoretical sampling and saturation logic. The book lists free calculators and language you can adapt.</p>

  <h3>What makes a convincing significance/innovation section?</h3>
  <p>Tie the gap to who benefits, what changes, and why now; show novelty (new data, method, population, or synthesis), and link outcomes to your field’s priorities. A short logic model helps reviewers see value at a glance.</p>

  <h3>How detailed should my timeline (Gantt chart) be?</h3>
  <p>Map tasks to months/weeks with clear milestones and dependencies (e.g., IRB → Recruitment → Data collection → Analysis → Write-up). The book includes a ready-to-edit Gantt template and risk-mitigation prompts for delays.</p>

  <h3>Do I need a budget and how do I justify it?</h3>
  <p>If required, itemize costs (participants, software, transcription, travel, RA time) and tie each line to a method step and deliverable. Keep numbers realistic and include in-kind support. A one-page justification template is provided.</p>

  <h3>What do reviewers reject most often?</h3>
  <p>Common deal-breakers: vague gap, misaligned methods, underpowered sample, weak measures, missing ethics plan, overambitious scope, or no feasibility evidence. Use the book’s pre-submission checklist to catch these.</p>

  <h3>How many references should I include and which style?</h3>
  <p>Follow the sponsor/program guide. Prioritize recent, high-quality sources that directly support your gap, methods, and measures. The book shows quick workflows for APA/MLA/Chicago with citation managers.</p>

  <h3>Do I need IRB/ethics approval before submitting?</h3>
  <p>Usually you outline your ethics plan in the proposal and obtain approval before data collection. Include consent/assent, data security, privacy, and risk minimization. A concise ethics plan template is included.</p>

  <h3>Can AI help with proposal writing without risking quality?</h3>
  <p>Yes—use AI to brainstorm alternatives, tighten language, check logic, and format, then verify facts, recalc numbers, and cite properly. The book includes guardrails, disclosure examples, and reviewer-safe usage patterns.</p>

  <h3>What does a strong abstract look like?</h3>
  <p>One paragraph covering context, gap, aims, approach (design/sample/measures), expected outcomes/impact, and feasibility. The Abstract Builder in the book gives a sentence-by-sentence scaffold.</p>
