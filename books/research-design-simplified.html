    <div class="sub">Choose the right method—fast, confidently, and with rigor.</div>
    <div class="hr"></div>

    <p><strong>Research Design Simplified</strong> gives you a clear <em>research blueprint</em> for
    selecting research methods that fit your question—whether you need
    <strong>qualitative</strong>, <strong>quantitative</strong>, or <strong>mixed methods research</strong>. Using a three-question
    <strong>Method Match test</strong>, you’ll move from uncertainty to a defensible design in minutes,
    then refine it with step-by-step templates and mini-cases.</p>

    <p>Inside you’ll learn practical strategies for <strong>sampling techniques</strong>, <strong>sample size
    determination</strong> (including quick power-analysis workflows), and how to safeguard
    <strong>validity and reliability</strong> (or trustworthiness) from the start. You’ll see exactly
    when to choose <em>qualitative vs quantitative</em> questions, how to design <strong>experimental
    designs</strong>, <strong>survey design</strong>, <strong>case studies</strong> and <strong>comparative studies</strong>, and how to
    frame <strong>hypothesis formulation</strong> or exploratory aims that lead to credible
    <strong>causal inference</strong>.</p>

    <ul class="feature-list">
      <li><strong>Method Match test:</strong> a quick decision tool to align question → design → analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>Study design templates:</strong> plug-in outlines for qual, quant, and mixed methods.</li>
      <li><strong>Sampling &amp; sample size:</strong> probability and purposive strategies with power-ready tips.</li>
      <li><strong>Validity &amp; reliability:</strong> easy checks and <em>research validity tests</em> you can apply immediately.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethics &amp; feasibility:</strong> tighten protocols with research ethics prompts and <em>pilot studies</em>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Whether you’re planning your first study or leveling up your <strong>research methodology</strong>,
    this guide replaces guesswork with reproducible decisions—and gives you the language
    reviewers expect when they ask, “Why this design?”</p>

  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I choose the right research design (qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods)?</summary>
    <p>Match design to the nature of your question: explore meanings/process → qualitative; test relationships/causality → quantitative; explain or triangulate complex phenomena → mixed methods. The book’s 3-question “Method Match” test walks you through the decision in minutes.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What’s the difference between qualitative and quantitative research questions?</summary>
    <p>Qualitative questions ask “how” or “why” about experiences or processes; quantitative questions specify variables and hypothesized relationships you can measure and test. Templates help you rewrite either type for clarity and rigor.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>When should I use mixed methods?</summary>
    <p>Use mixed methods when one strand alone can’t answer the question. Common patterns include <em>convergent</em> (collect qual + quant in parallel) and <em>explanatory sequential</em> (quant first, qual explains results). The book gives step-by-step designs and sample write-ups.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I pick a sampling strategy?</summary>
    <p>For quantitative, use probability methods (simple random, stratified, cluster) to generalize and run stats. For qualitative, use purposive/theoretical sampling to capture information-rich cases. Checklists help you justify size and selection.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I determine sample size or run a power analysis?</summary>
    <p>Quantitative studies should estimate effect sizes and run a priori power analyses (α, power, expected effect). The book includes a quick workflow and free tool suggestions to justify n clearly.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I ensure validity and reliability (or trustworthiness) in my design?</summary>
    <p>Quant: address construct, internal, and external validity plus reliability of instruments. Qual: establish credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability via triangulation, audit trails, and member checks. You get checklists for both.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Which data collection methods fit my design?</summary>
    <p>Quant: surveys, experiments, standardized tests, logs. Qual: interviews, focus groups, observations, documents. Mixed: combine strategically with a clear integration plan (merging, connecting, or embedding).</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I operationalize variables and choose measures?</summary>
    <p>Define constructs, map them to observable indicators, select or adapt validated instruments, and pilot test. Templates help you document scales, items, scoring, and evidence of validity.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What analyses pair with each design?</summary>
    <p>Quant: descriptives → t-tests/ANOVA/χ² → regression/GLMs; Qual: coding → categories → themes/theory (e.g., thematic analysis, grounded theory). Mixed: integrate at design, analysis, and interpretation stages. Mini-cases show end-to-end examples.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I write a strong methods section that satisfies reviewers?</summary>
    <p>State design and rationale, participants/sampling, instruments and procedures, analysis plan, validity/quality safeguards, and limitations. Use the book’s structured template to avoid common gaps.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do I need ethics/IRB approval and consent language?</summary>
    <p>If you work with human data, yes. The book provides a pre-IRB checklist (risk, privacy, data security, consent/assent, disclosure) and example language you can adapt.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can I use AI tools during design without compromising rigor?</summary>
    <p>Yes—use AI to brainstorm alternatives, refine questions, and draft instrument items, then verify with validated sources and pilot tests. The book includes safe-use guardrails and disclosure tips.</p>
