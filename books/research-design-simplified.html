  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I choose the right research design (qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods)?</summary>
    <p>Match design to the nature of your question: explore meanings/process → qualitative; test relationships/causality → quantitative; explain or triangulate complex phenomena → mixed methods. The book’s 3-question “Method Match” test walks you through the decision in minutes.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What’s the difference between qualitative and quantitative research questions?</summary>
    <p>Qualitative questions ask “how” or “why” about experiences or processes; quantitative questions specify variables and hypothesized relationships you can measure and test. Templates help you rewrite either type for clarity and rigor.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>When should I use mixed methods?</summary>
    <p>Use mixed methods when one strand alone can’t answer the question. Common patterns include <em>convergent</em> (collect qual + quant in parallel) and <em>explanatory sequential</em> (quant first, qual explains results). The book gives step-by-step designs and sample write-ups.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I pick a sampling strategy?</summary>
    <p>For quantitative, use probability methods (simple random, stratified, cluster) to generalize and run stats. For qualitative, use purposive/theoretical sampling to capture information-rich cases. Checklists help you justify size and selection.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I determine sample size or run a power analysis?</summary>
    <p>Quantitative studies should estimate effect sizes and run a priori power analyses (α, power, expected effect). The book includes a quick workflow and free tool suggestions to justify n clearly.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I ensure validity and reliability (or trustworthiness) in my design?</summary>
    <p>Quant: address construct, internal, and external validity plus reliability of instruments. Qual: establish credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability via triangulation, audit trails, and member checks. You get checklists for both.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Which data collection methods fit my design?</summary>
    <p>Quant: surveys, experiments, standardized tests, logs. Qual: interviews, focus groups, observations, documents. Mixed: combine strategically with a clear integration plan (merging, connecting, or embedding).</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I operationalize variables and choose measures?</summary>
    <p>Define constructs, map them to observable indicators, select or adapt validated instruments, and pilot test. Templates help you document scales, items, scoring, and evidence of validity.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What analyses pair with each design?</summary>
    <p>Quant: descriptives → t-tests/ANOVA/χ² → regression/GLMs; Qual: coding → categories → themes/theory (e.g., thematic analysis, grounded theory). Mixed: integrate at design, analysis, and interpretation stages. Mini-cases show end-to-end examples.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I write a strong methods section that satisfies reviewers?</summary>
    <p>State design and rationale, participants/sampling, instruments and procedures, analysis plan, validity/quality safeguards, and limitations. Use the book’s structured template to avoid common gaps.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do I need ethics/IRB approval and consent language?</summary>
    <p>If you work with human data, yes. The book provides a pre-IRB checklist (risk, privacy, data security, consent/assent, disclosure) and example language you can adapt.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can I use AI tools during design without compromising rigor?</summary>
    <p>Yes—use AI to brainstorm alternatives, refine questions, and draft instrument items, then verify with validated sources and pilot tests. The book includes safe-use guardrails and disclosure tips.</p>
