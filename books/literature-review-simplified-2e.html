  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <h3>What’s new in the Second Edition?</h3>
  <p>An updated 10-step Rapid-Synthesis System, clearer chapter flow with tables/infographics, two fully worked sample reviews, and bonus chapters on mixed-methods, AI-assisted reviews, and meta-analysis.</p>

  <h3>Can I really finish a literature review in 4 weeks?</h3>
  <p>Yes—if you follow the weekly milestones: scope & questions → targeted search → triage & evaluation → thematic synthesis → structured drafting → polish and references.</p>

  <h3>How does the Rapid-Synthesis System reduce time?</h3>
  <p>It replaces open-ended reading with repeatable steps: build a search plan, triage quickly, map themes with concept maps/evidence matrices, then draft from your synthesis notes—not the PDFs.</p>

  <h3>Which AI search hacks are covered?</h3>
  <p>You’ll learn prompt patterns for quicker keyword discovery, related-paper expansion, and abstract screening. The book shows how to use these ethically with verification and disclosure.</p>

  <h3>Theme-based or chronological structure—what’s best?</h3>
  <p>Theme-first is recommended. Use chronology only when historical development matters. You’ll get templates for thematic sections, transitions, and writing up debates and gaps.</p>

  <h3>How many sources do I need?</h3>
  <p>Quality over quantity. Many programs expect 25–80+ peer-reviewed sources depending on topic and level. The book shows how to balance seminal works with recent studies and avoid padding.</p>

  <h3>Does it include templates I can reuse?</h3>
  <p>Yes—search logs, screening checklists, note/synthesis sheets, outline planners, and an evidence-matrix template to turn notes into defensible themes.</p>

  <h3>Will this help with mixed-methods topics?</h3>
  <p>Yes. The bonus chapter explains how to synthesize qualitative and quantitative strands, report convergences/divergences, and link to a mixed-methods design.</p>

  <h3>What if my supervisor expects a meta-analysis?</h3>
  <p>The book clarifies the difference between narrative/thematic reviews and meta-analysis, and explains when formal quantitative synthesis is appropriate and how to report effect-size evidence at a high level.</p>

  <h3>How do I avoid plagiarism while paraphrasing?</h3>
  <p>Use idea-level rephrasing, restructure claims, cite accurately, and track page numbers for direct quotes. You’ll get paraphrasing moves and citation patterns for APA/MLA/etc.</p>

  <h3>Common mistakes this book helps me avoid?</h3>
  <p>Summarizing instead of synthesizing, unclear scope, missing recent work, weak gap statement, and inconsistent referencing. Each has a checklist and quick fixes.</p>

  <h3>Is it suitable for my field?</h3>
  <p>Yes. Examples span social sciences, education, health, and STEM; the method is discipline-agnostic and focuses on rigorous, transparent synthesis.</p>
