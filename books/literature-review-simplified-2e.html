<div class="sub">Finish a rigorous literature review in weeks—not months.</div>
<div class="hr"></div>

<p>
<strong>Literature Review Simplified: A Practical Guide for Beginners (Second Edition)</strong> introduces a refined
<strong>10-step Rapid-Synthesis System</strong> with new visuals and bonus chapters on
<strong>mixed-methods reviews</strong>, <strong>AI-assisted literature review</strong>, and high-level
<strong>meta-analysis</strong> techniques. You’ll move from question and <em>search strategy development</em>
to <em>evidence synthesis</em> and polished write-up using practical templates and matrices.
</p>

<p>
Build a transparent workflow aligned to <strong>PRISMA guidelines</strong>, manage sources with
<strong>citation management (Zotero)</strong>, and incorporate <em>grey literature search</em> when needed.
You’ll learn <em>conceptual mapping</em>, <em>critical appraisal</em>, and how to surface
<em>research gaps</em>—then turn notes into defensible <em>narrative synthesis</em>, <em>scoping reviews</em>,
or a plan for <em>systematic review planning</em> and meta-analysis.
</p>

<ul class="feature-list">
  <li><strong>Rapid-Synthesis System:</strong> 10 steps from focused question → search → triage → synthesis → chapter.</li>
  <li><strong>Search strategy development:</strong> keywords, Boolean strings, databases, and <em>AI search hacks</em> for speed.</li>
  <li><strong>Evidence matrices:</strong> reusable tables for themes, methods, effects, and quality ratings.</li>
  <li><strong>Reporting with PRISMA:</strong> flow diagram guidance, inclusion/exclusion logic, and transparency notes.</li>
  <li><strong>Mixed-methods reviews:</strong> integrate qualitative and quantitative findings with clear linking logic.</li>
  <li><strong>Meta-analysis primer:</strong> effect-size concepts, heterogeneity basics, and when to synthesize quantitatively.</li>
  <li><strong>Zotero workflow:</strong> collections, tags, deduping, cite-while-you-write, and export tips.</li>
  <li><strong>Research synthesis tools:</strong> matrices, concept maps, and checklists that accelerate drafting.</li>
  <li><strong>Writing literature review chapters:</strong> structure, voice, and model paragraphs for each section.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Use the included <strong>evidence matrices</strong> and planners to convert reading into
publishable arguments—so your chapter makes a clear case for the field’s state,
the <em>research gaps</em> that matter, and why your study is the next logical step.

  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>What’s new in the Second Edition?</summary>
    <p>An updated 10-step Rapid-Synthesis System, clearer chapter flow with tables/infographics, two fully worked sample reviews, and bonus chapters on mixed-methods, AI-assisted reviews, and meta-analysis.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can I really finish a literature review in 4 weeks?</summary>
    <p>Yes—if you follow the weekly milestones: scope &amp; questions → targeted search → triage &amp; evaluation → thematic synthesis → structured drafting → polish and references.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How does the Rapid-Synthesis System reduce time?</summary>
    <p>It replaces open-ended reading with repeatable steps: build a search plan, triage quickly, map themes with concept maps/evidence matrices, then draft from your synthesis notes—not the PDFs.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Which AI search hacks are covered?</summary>
    <p>You’ll learn prompt patterns for quicker keyword discovery, related-paper expansion, and abstract screening. The book shows how to use these ethically with verification and disclosure.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Theme-based or chronological structure—what’s best?</summary>
    <p>Theme-first is recommended. Use chronology only when historical development matters. You’ll get templates for thematic sections, transitions, and writing up debates and gaps.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How many sources do I need?</summary>
    <p>Quality over quantity. Many programs expect 25–80+ peer-reviewed sources depending on topic and level. The book shows how to balance seminal works with recent studies and avoid padding.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Does it include templates I can reuse?</summary>
    <p>Yes—search logs, screening checklists, note/synthesis sheets, outline planners, and an evidence-matrix template to turn notes into defensible themes.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Will this help with mixed-methods topics?</summary>
    <p>Yes. The bonus chapter explains how to synthesize qualitative and quantitative strands, report convergences/divergences, and link to a mixed-methods design.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What if my supervisor expects a meta-analysis?</summary>
    <p>The book clarifies the difference between narrative/thematic reviews and meta-analysis, and explains when formal quantitative synthesis is appropriate and how to report effect-size evidence at a high level.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I avoid plagiarism while paraphrasing?</summary>
    <p>Use idea-level rephrasing, restructure claims, cite accurately, and track page numbers for direct quotes. You’ll get paraphrasing moves and citation patterns for APA/MLA/etc.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Common mistakes this book helps me avoid?</summary>
    <p>Summarizing instead of synthesizing, unclear scope, missing recent work, weak gap statement, and inconsistent referencing. Each has a checklist and quick fixes.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is it suitable for my field?</summary>
    <p>Yes. Examples span social sciences, education, health, and STEM; the method is discipline-agnostic and focuses on rigorous, transparent synthesis.</p>
