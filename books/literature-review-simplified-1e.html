<div class="sub">The fastest way to plan, search, evaluate, and write a clear literature review.</div>
<div class="hr"></div>

<p>
<strong>Literature Review Simplified (First Edition)</strong> lays the foundation for
credible evidence synthesis—without the overwhelm. You’ll learn
<strong>research question formulation</strong>, practical <strong>search strategy development</strong>
with <em>Boolean search operators</em>, and smart <strong>database selection</strong> (e.g., PubMed, Scopus)
to find the right studies quickly.
</p>

<p>
Move from raw results to a defensible <strong>evidence matrix</strong> using clear
<strong>inclusion and exclusion criteria</strong>, <strong>source evaluation</strong>, and <strong>critical appraisal tools</strong>.
Then convert notes into a polished <em>narrative synthesis</em> or <em>systematic review basics</em>:
<em>data extraction</em>, <strong>thematic categorisation</strong>, and a reliable <strong>literature review structure</strong>.
Short, focused, and ideal for tight timelines, this first edition prioritizes the essentials.
</p>

<ul class="feature-list">
  <li><strong>Question design:</strong> turn topics into sharp, searchable questions.</li>
  <li><strong>Search strategy:</strong> keywords, Boolean strings, and <em>database selection</em> (PubMed, Scopus).</li>
  <li><strong>Screening workflow:</strong> <em>inclusion/exclusion criteria</em>, quick triage, and bias checks.</li>
  <li><strong>Evidence matrix:</strong> reusable table for study details, methods, findings, and quality.</li>
  <li><strong>Critical appraisal:</strong> tools and prompts to judge rigor and relevance.</li>
  <li><strong>Data extraction &amp; themes:</strong> from notes to <em>thematic categorisation</em> and arguments.</li>
  <li><strong>Writing the chapter:</strong> proven <em>literature review structure</em> with model paragraph moves.</li>
  <li><strong>Citation management:</strong> organise references and styles with <em>reference management</em> tips.</li>
  <li><strong>Review timeline:</strong> a realistic plan for finishing on schedule.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Use the included checklists and templates to go from searches to a coherent, publishable
chapter—fast. Perfect for first-time reviewers or anyone working within time constraints.

  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can I really complete a literature review in 4 weeks?</summary>
    <p>Yes. The 10-step method breaks the process into focused weekly goals—question design, targeted search, triage and evaluation, synthesis, structured drafting, and polish—so you avoid open-ended reading and move steadily to a finished review.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is this book suitable for beginners?</summary>
    <p>Absolutely. It’s written for first-time reviewers (undergrad, taught master’s) and is equally useful as a refresher for thesis/dissertation writers who want a clear, repeatable process.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What’s the difference between a literature review and an annotated bibliography?</summary>
    <p>An annotated bibliography summarizes sources one by one. A literature review <em>synthesizes</em> them—grouping studies by themes, methods, debates, and gaps—to build an argument and justify your research direction.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Should I organize by theme or chronology?</summary>
    <p>Theme-first is recommended. Use time-order only when historical development is crucial. The book shows how to convert notes into defensible themes and sub-themes with clear transitions.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How many sources do I need?</summary>
    <p>Quality beats quantity. Programs often expect 25–80+ scholarly sources, depending on scope and level. The book shows how to define scope, avoid padding, and prioritize <em>seminal and recent</em> studies.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What tools do you recommend?</summary>
    <p>Start with Google Scholar/library databases; manage references with Zotero or Mendeley; use concept maps/evidence matrices to turn notes into synthesis. Links and templates are provided in the book.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I evaluate sources quickly and reliably?</summary>
    <p>Use triage criteria: relevance to the question, study design and rigor, sample/setting, limitations, and contribution. The method includes quick-screen checklists and note templates.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What’s a good structure for the review?</summary>
    <p>Typical flow: introduction and scope → search strategy → thematic sections (with debates/contradictions) → gap statement → implications for your study. The book includes outline templates and model paragraphs.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I paraphrase without plagiarizing?</summary>
    <p>Summarize claims in your own structure, attribute ideas, and cite accurately. The book includes paraphrasing moves, signal phrases, and citation patterns to maintain academic integrity.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Common mistakes to avoid?</summary>
    <p>Listing studies instead of synthesizing; unclear scope; missing recent work; weak gap statement; over-quoting; inconsistent citation style. Each is addressed with fixes and checklists.</p>
