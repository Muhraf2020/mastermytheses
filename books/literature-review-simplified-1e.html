  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can I really complete a literature review in 4 weeks?</summary>
    <p>Yes. The 10-step method breaks the process into focused weekly goals—question design, targeted search, triage and evaluation, synthesis, structured drafting, and polish—so you avoid open-ended reading and move steadily to a finished review.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is this book suitable for beginners?</summary>
    <p>Absolutely. It’s written for first-time reviewers (undergrad, taught master’s) and is equally useful as a refresher for thesis/dissertation writers who want a clear, repeatable process.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What’s the difference between a literature review and an annotated bibliography?</summary>
    <p>An annotated bibliography summarizes sources one by one. A literature review <em>synthesizes</em> them—grouping studies by themes, methods, debates, and gaps—to build an argument and justify your research direction.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Should I organize by theme or chronology?</summary>
    <p>Theme-first is recommended. Use time-order only when historical development is crucial. The book shows how to convert notes into defensible themes and sub-themes with clear transitions.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How many sources do I need?</summary>
    <p>Quality beats quantity. Programs often expect 25–80+ scholarly sources, depending on scope and level. The book shows how to define scope, avoid padding, and prioritize <em>seminal and recent</em> studies.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What tools do you recommend?</summary>
    <p>Start with Google Scholar/library databases; manage references with Zotero or Mendeley; use concept maps/evidence matrices to turn notes into synthesis. Links and templates are provided in the book.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I evaluate sources quickly and reliably?</summary>
    <p>Use triage criteria: relevance to the question, study design and rigor, sample/setting, limitations, and contribution. The method includes quick-screen checklists and note templates.</p>

  <details>
    <summary>What’s a good structure for the review?</summary>

  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do I paraphrase without plagiarizing?</summary>
    <p>Summarize claims in your own structure, attribute ideas, and cite accurately. The book includes paraphrasing moves, signal phrases, and citation patterns to maintain academic integrity.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Common mistakes to avoid?</summary>
    <p>Listing studies instead of synthesizing; unclear scope; missing recent work; weak gap statement; over-quoting; inconsistent citation style. Each is addressed with fixes and checklists.</p>
