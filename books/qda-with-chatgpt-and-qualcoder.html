  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <h3>Can I really use ChatGPT for qualitative coding and thematic analysis?</h3>
  <p>Yes—when used as an assistant. This book shows prompt patterns that help you generate initial codes, memos, and theme candidates, while you keep final judgment and rigor.</p>

  <h3>How do ChatGPT and QualCoder work together?</h3>
  <p>QualCoder handles transcripts, manual coding, and exports. ChatGPT accelerates open coding, pattern spotting, and theme drafts. You’ll iterate between both to refine a defensible codebook.</p>

  <h3>Is QualCoder free? Do I need NVivo or Atlas.ti?</h3>
  <p>QualCoder is free and open-source. You can complete full projects in QualCoder, or use it alongside commercial tools. The book includes a side-by-side workflow and export tips.</p>

  <h3>What data formats can I analyze (interviews, focus groups, CSV)?</h3>
  <p>Interviews, focus groups, field notes, and CSV text are supported. The guide covers preparing transcripts, cleaning text, and chunking long files for reliable AI prompts.</p>

  <h3>How do I build a robust, transparent codebook with AI?</h3>
  <p>You’ll start with researcher-generated seed codes, use AI to propose refinements and examples, and document inclusions/exclusions and anchor quotes to ensure traceability.</p>

  <h3>Does the book cover intercoder reliability/trustworthiness?</h3>
  <p>Yes. It shows consensus coding, audit trails, code-definition tests, and strategies for dependability and confirmability—plus how to log AI involvement clearly.</p>

  <h3>What about ethics, IRB, and privacy when using AI tools?</h3>
  <p>You’ll get redaction and de-identification checklists, disclosure language, and offline/limited-data workflows to protect participants and align with IRB/GDPR expectations.</p>

  <h3>Will AI “hallucinate” themes or distort findings?</h3>
  <p>It can if unguarded. The book includes verification prompts, triangulation steps, and rules for keeping human oversight central so themes remain data-grounded.</p>

  <h3>Can I use this for grounded theory, IPA, or thematic analysis?</h3>
  <p>Yes. Examples show how to adapt prompts and coding moves to GT, IPA, and reflexive thematic analysis while preserving each method’s logic.</p>

  <h3>How do I export codes and quotes for my thesis or paper?</h3>
  <p>You’ll learn to export codebooks, coded segments, and frequency tables from QualCoder, and to format evidence tables and theme write-ups ready for publication.</p>

  <h3>Do you provide reusable prompt templates?</h3>
  <p>Yes—starter prompts for open/axial coding, theme testing, discrepant cases, memoing, and method-specific write-ups you can adapt to your corpus.</p>

  <h3>Is this suitable for beginners to qualitative research?</h3>
  <p>Absolutely. The workflow assumes no prior coding software experience and emphasizes transparency, reflexivity, and method-fit over “automation.”</p>
