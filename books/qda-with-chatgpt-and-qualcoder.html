<div class="hr"></div>

<p>
<strong>Qualitative Data Analysis with ChatGPT &amp; QualCoder</strong> shows how to combine human
judgment with <em>AI-assisted coding</em> to speed up rigorous <strong>qualitative data analysis</strong>.
You’ll set up ChatGPT and run a step-by-step <strong>QualCoder tutorial</strong>, then use prompt
patterns to draft code ideas, memos, and early themes—while you keep control of
definitions, decisions, and interpretation.
</p>

<p>
Build a defensible <strong>codebook</strong> for <em>inductive coding</em> and <em>deductive coding</em>, run
<em>thematic analysis</em>, and adapt workflows for <em>grounded theory coding</em>, <em>content analysis</em>,
and <em>narrative analysis</em>. You’ll calculate <strong>coding reliability</strong> (consensus + metrics),
document <strong>reflexivity in qualitative research</strong>, and apply clear guardrails for
<strong>AI ethics in qualitative research</strong>—so your methods remain transparent and reproducible.
</p>

<ul class="feature-list">
  <li><strong>QualCoder workflow:</strong> import transcripts, segment data, manage codes, and export results.</li>
  <li><strong>ChatGPT for qualitative research:</strong> prompt templates for open coding, memoing, and theme testing.</li>
  <li><strong>Building codebooks:</strong> names, definitions, inclusion/exclusion rules, and anchor quotes.</li>
  <li><strong>Intercoder reliability:</strong> consensus steps plus quick checks for agreement and stability.</li>
  <li><strong>Interview &amp; focus group analysis:</strong> practical moves for turn-taking, co-occurrence, and saturation.</li>
  <li><strong>Free qualitative coding tools:</strong> set-ups and exports you can reproduce without paid software.</li>
  <li><strong>Mixed methods coding:</strong> link qualitative themes with survey or log data for triangulation.</li>
  <li><strong>Data prep:</strong> <em>dataset transcription</em>, cleaning, chunking long files, and privacy-first redaction.</li>
  <li><strong>Ethics &amp; transparency:</strong> disclose AI assistance, keep audit trails, and protect participants.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Use the included <strong>qualitative research workflow</strong> to move from raw transcripts to
publishable findings: prepare data → open/axial coding → theme building → evidence
tables → write-up. Each step includes prompts, examples, and exports you can drop
straight into your thesis or paper.

  <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can I really use ChatGPT for qualitative coding and thematic analysis?</summary>
    <p>Yes—when used as an assistant. This book shows prompt patterns that help you generate initial codes, memos, and theme candidates, while you keep final judgment and rigor.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How do ChatGPT and QualCoder work together?</summary>
    <p>QualCoder handles transcripts, manual coding, and exports. ChatGPT accelerates open coding, pattern spotting, and theme drafts. You’ll iterate between both to refine a defensible codebook.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is QualCoder free? Do I need NVivo or Atlas.ti?</summary>
    <p>QualCoder is free and open-source. You can complete full projects in QualCoder, or use it alongside commercial tools. The book includes a side-by-side workflow and export tips.</p>

    <p>It can if unguarded. The book includes verification prompts, triangulation steps, and rules for keeping human oversight central so themes remain data-grounded.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can I use this for grounded theory, IPA, or thematic analysis?</summary>
    <p>Yes. Examples show how to adapt prompts and coding moves to GT, IPA, and reflexive thematic analysis while preserving each method’s logic.</p>
